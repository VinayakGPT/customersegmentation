# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
# Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (customersegmentation.ipynb) that demonstrates the implementation of customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. The objective of the project is to categorize customers based on their spending patterns and annual income, allowing for targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the customer data for clustering by handling missing values, normalizing features, and visualizing distributions.
K-Means Clustering: Implements the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
Cluster Optimization: Uses the Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
Visualization: Visualizes the clusters and their centroids using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

# Dependencies
To run the notebook, the following Python libraries are required:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
